# Product Inventory Management System 

The product inventory management system is a web application that allows users to manage product information such as name, description, price, and quantity. The application should have a user interface to add, edit, and delete products. Additionally, the application should validate user input using Fluent Validation and store the data in a SQL Server database. Please make sure to provide the SQL to create your database/tables as well as SQL to create mock data for the table.
